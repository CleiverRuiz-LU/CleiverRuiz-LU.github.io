# [Cleiver's Hugo Academic CV Theme](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv)

[![Screenshot](.github/preview.webp)](https://hugoblox.com/templates/)

I am creating my personal Academic CV Website using Hugo. The advantage of using Hugo is that you can use text Markdown, LaTeX Math, diagrams, RMarkdown, or Jupyter, and import publications from BibTeX.

For information about the template, visit the GitHub repository at [HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv).

## Personal Documentation

### Getting Started
To get started with the Hugo Academic CV Theme, follow the official guide [here](https://docs.hugoblox.com/tutorial/).

### Working Locally on macOS
1. **Install Hugo and other dependences**: If you haven't installed Hugo yet, you can do so using Homebrew. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   brew install git golang hugo node
   ```

4. **Add HUGO to ~/.zsh**: Open the hidden ~/.zshrc (or ~/.bashrc) file in a text editor, add the following line, and restart your Terminal app so that Hugo can find the location of its Go dependency:
   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
   ```

5. **View Website**: View your site by running the following command:
   ```bash
   hugo server -D
   ```
   Hugo then provides you with a link (e.g. http://localhost:1313/) to open in your web browser.

    For help troubleshooting common Hugo errors, check out the [Troubleshooting guide](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/troubleshooting/).
