I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who supported me during my recent mission trip. Thank you to everyone who reposted, shared, and donated. It was an incredible experience for which I am immensely grateful.

Through advanced parole, I had the opportunity to join the Honduras Outreach International (HOI) mission, where I helped install solar panels at a local elementary school, provided educational resources, and translated between the staff and my team in order to effectively troubleshoot any problems.

The experience was profound on multiple levels. Not only did it provide me with the chance to educate the next generation of leaders, but it also marked my first time outside the borders of the United States. For so long, I was not allowed to leave the USA because of my undocumented status, but with the support of my community and organizations like TIRRC and JFON, I was able to apply for advanced parole. I am grateful that my first time outside the United States was spent providing a service related to my career, alongside my professors and school.

I will always remember the experienceâ€”the feeling of being the first person in my family to leave the USA and being allowed to come back was something that I understand is only afforded to a few. The support I received from my professors during this process also helped me create stronger bonds. I know that leaving and entering the USA was definitely a scary process, and having teachers who understood the situation, were willing to work with my fears, and supported me throughout the journey was very helpful. 

I was also supported by the school through Lipscomb UCC services, where I was connected with counselors and therapists who helped me understand where my fears stemmed from. I know this process was scary and new, but it has helped me move forward toward obtaining my green card, for which I am eternally grateful. I now have a lawful entry into the USA and can proceed with becoming a permanent resident.
