I was invited to share my experiences with TIRRC VOTES over the 2023 Summer Break. It was my first instance of being able to talk in a public setting where my experiences in engaging with my community made me a leader. As an undocumented student, civic engagement through door knocking, connecting with organizations, and building a network of resources helps us support our families and future generations.

> "At the conclusion of the Tennessee Campus Civic Summit, dozens of college students from across the state left even more committed to returning to their universities and communities and immersing themselves in both political and social activities."
